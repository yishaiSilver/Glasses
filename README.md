This is a simple program derived from multiple other programs, including Google's im2txt and object_detection tensorflow models as well as the face_recognition module and the playsound module. It works with multithreading to provide a live, high-FPS opencv window that is labeled with information as the information is processed. Its ultimate purpose is to provide simple functionalities like object detection, facial recognition, and a verbal description of what is seen.

It is a mess as I haven't been able to work on it in a while, and you'll need to import the modules mentioned above for it to work, but I will try to clean it up asap. Likewise, I'm trying to get a hold of a Jetson Nano so I can see how well this performs on that.
